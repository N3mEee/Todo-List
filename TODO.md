## New:

-   The user should be able to delete a task
-   The user should be able to delete a list with all the tasks in it
-   The user should be able to expand a single todo to see/edit its details
-   Split all the task DOM and logic from updateTasksDOM.JS

## Bugs:

-   The user can create multiple lists with the same name (this should not be possible)
-   The user can create multiple tasks with the same name (this should not be possible)
-   Pressing enter refreshes the page (preventDefault() should fix it)
