# User Stories

-   as a user I should be able to see inside the sidebar how many active tasks are in every list/project
    -   the number should be visible on the right side of the list and it should be updated accordingly
-   as a user I should be able to see inside the sidebar what list is currently selected
    -   the bg color of the list should be updated accordingly
-   as a user I should be able to pick an icon for the list and see it in the sidebar.
