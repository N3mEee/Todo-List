# User Stories

-   as a user I should be able to see inside the sidebar how many active tasks are in every list/project
    -   the number should be visible on the right side of the list and it should be updated accordingly
-   as a user I should be able to see inside the sidebar what list is currently selected
    -   the bg color of the list should be updated accordingly

# Bugs:

-   clicking on the sidebar>list>icon sometimes doesn't work

# TODO:

-   Style
    -   when poput is called everything behind it should be blurred

# Notes:

-   design https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-09-01-at-10-41-51-am-1630511776581.png
