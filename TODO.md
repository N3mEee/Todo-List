# User Stories

-   as a user I should be able to see inside the sidebar what list is currently selected
    -   the bg color of the list should be updated accordingly
-   as a user I should be able to pick an icon for the list and see it in the sidebar.

# Bugs:

-   clicking on the sidebar>list>icon sometimes doesn't work
-   fix js form validation

# TODO:

-   Only show active task in the sidebar counters
-   Style
-   Add a task view where the user can only see informations and change the current task vew name to task edit
